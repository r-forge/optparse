optparse 1.0.2
==============
* We now replace all occurrences of %prog in usage message (including description and epilogue).
  Previously we would only replace one occurrence and didn't make replacements in description and epilogue.
* Fix bug in ``parse_args`` when we have options with no short flag and positional_arguments=TRUE.
  Thanks Miroslav Posta for bug report.

optparse 1.0.0
==============

  users to add more information to generated help messages
* Slightly alters the generated usage string 
  to match more closely what the Python module does
* No longer exports S4 classes that represent OptionParser and OptionParserOption
* Now requires package getopt (>= 1.19) which has also been moved to 
  Imports field from Depends field in DESCRIPTION
